joe:
probability of x vector coming from participant's G
effect sizes
continuous vs discrete time
data table



P(x|z) using rho function -->
 if z is known, then x P(x|z) is either 1 or 0
 rho function is really P(x|z of length L)
 not clear why this is what we want

but given that... i can compute P(g|x) for a finite set G
but how to exrapolate and say this G is probable because it has certain edges

aren't we just penalizing long Zs in both steps, P(x|z) and P(z|g)?
wouldnt this just predict a graph where all xs are connected?
not true if we had timing data
